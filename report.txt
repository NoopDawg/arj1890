Does it: put an X inside the [] for your answer
	[] crash?
	[] infinite loop when it should not?
	[] only work in printed mode?
	[X] work fine?
	[] only implement these options: [list them below]
	[] other? Explain below.


How does your move algorithm work? Describe briefly in English.

The move algorithm finds the first unhappy agent, moves him to the 
first vacant spot, and leaves a placeholder at his previous location.
This leaves only locations available at the start of the cycle available
until the cycle is over and placeholders are replaced with empty spots.



============= SIMULATION ANALYSIS ==============

What did you find most revealing about the simulation?

At some of the lower values for preference strength and 
higher vacancies, there were configurations that allowed
everyone to be adequately happy.





============= GENERAL PROJECT FEEDBACK ==============

What did I learn?

Utilized 2D-arrays.
Updating arrays in a function
Changing variable values by passing pointers through a function
getopt usage.


What was easy about this assignment?

Writing out help commands. 
implementing display.


What gave you problems or troubles?

The happiness check functions were the most challenging. 
Also dealing with boundary conditions of a 2D array without
too many lines of code.

What should the instructor do to improve this assignment?

An example of the infinite run mode would be nice to see.


What would you have liked to do in this assignment?

I did not use malloc for any part of this project.
It would be nice to practice that.
